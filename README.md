# HomeFix - Home Repair Service App

> üìñ Vietnamese: [README.vi.md](./README.vi.md)

## Overview
HomeFix is a mobile application built with React Native (Expo) and TypeScript that simulates a home repair service booking system. The project focuses on user experience, clean and scalable code architecture, and is suitable for learning, demos, or as a foundation for real-world development.


## üîë User Flow & Features

### 1. Role Selection & Sample Login
- On app launch, user selects a role: **Customer** or **Technician** (Admin coming soon).
- Then, pick a sample user to quickly log in (sample data provided).

### 2. Customer Flow
- Book a service via a dynamic form (auto-filled with sample user info).
- View confirmation of the newly created order.
- Manage all your orders in the "Order Management" tab (see only your own orders).
- Receive notification when a technician accepts your order.

### 3. Technician Flow
- See a list of **unassigned orders** or **orders assigned to yourself** only.
- Accept new orders (only one technician can accept each order; others will no longer see it).
- Unassign (cancel) an order (order returns to unassigned state, visible to all technicians again).
- Update order status (only for orders you have accepted).

### 4. Admin Flow (coming soon)
- Manage the whole system, view all orders, users, etc.

### 5. UI & Experience
- Modern, mobile-optimized UI.
- Multiple order statuses, role-based order detail popups.

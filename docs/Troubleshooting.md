# Troubleshooting

## Navigation Issues
- Ensure all navigation dependencies are installed
- Check TypeScript types in `types/index.ts`
- For Bottom Tab errors, verify screen names and nested navigator structure

## AsyncStorage Issues
- If orders are not saved, check storage permissions and AsyncStorage status

## Expo Build Issues
- Ensure correct versions of React Native, Expo, and dependencies as in package.json

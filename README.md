# HomeFix - Home Repair Service App

> 📖 Vietnamese: [README.vi.md](./README.vi.md)

## Overview
HomeFix is a mobile application built with React Native (Expo) and TypeScript that simulates a home repair service booking system. The project focuses on user experience, clean and scalable code architecture, and is suitable for learning, demos, or as a foundation for real-world development.

## 🔑 User Flow & Features

### 1. Role Selection & Sample Login
- On app launch, user selects a role: **Customer** or **Technician** (Admin coming soon).
- Then, pick a sample user to quickly log in (sample data provided).

### 2. Customer Flow
- Book a service via a dynamic form (auto-filled with sample user info).
- View confirmation of the newly created order.
- Manage all your orders in the "Order Management" tab (see only your own orders).
- Receive notification when a technician accepts your order.

### 3. Technician Flow
- See a list of **unassigned orders** or **orders assigned to yourself** only.
- Accept new orders (only one technician can accept each order; others will no longer see it).
- Unassign (cancel) an order (order returns to unassigned state, visible to all technicians again).
- Update order status (only for orders you have accepted).

### 4. Admin Flow (coming soon)
- Manage the whole system, view all orders, users, etc.

### 5. UI & Experience
- Modern, mobile-optimized UI.
- Multiple order statuses, role-based order detail popups.

## � Getting Started

1. **Clone repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd home-repair-service
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   npm run android   # Android
   npm run ios       # iOS (macOS)
   npm run web       # Web
   ```

## 🧱 Architecture

- **Frontend**: React Native (Expo), TypeScript
- **State Management**: React Context API + AsyncStorage
- **Navigation**: React Navigation v6 (Stack + Bottom Tabs)
- **Backend**: Mock only (easily replaceable with REST/GraphQL)
- **Scalable Design**: Modular file structure, easy to extend

## 🧑‍💻 Using & Editing Mock Data

- Sample user data (customers/technicians) is located in `home-repair-service/mock-data/`:
  - `mockCustomers.json`: List of sample customers
  - `mockWorkers.json`: List of sample technicians
- When selecting a role, you will pick a sample user to log in quickly.
- You can edit/add sample users by modifying the corresponding JSON file (add/edit/delete users, change info, etc.).
- When creating an order, the form will be auto-filled with the selected sample user's info.
